## Summary

The Tetris Game project is an interactive web application built using
  modern web technologies, including React, Redux Toolkit, Webpack,
  Babel, and deployed on Netlify. This project was designed to showcase
  proficiency in front-end development, state management with Redux,
  and efficient deployment practices.

This build was inspired by [this](https://github.com/Tech-at-DU/React-Redux-Tetris-Tutorial).

## Features

1. **Classic Tetris Gameplay**: The application faithfully replicates the
  classic Tetris experience, providing players with the familiar challenge
  of arranging falling blocks to create complete lines.

2. **React Components**: The game's user interface is built using React,
  allowing for a modular and efficient component-based architecture. This
  enables easy customization and maintenance of the game's various elements.

3. **Redux State Management**: Redux and Redux Toolkit were employed to
  manage the game's state, ensuring a predictable and centralized approach to
  handling game logic, score tracking, and level progression.

4. **Webpack and Babel Setup**: The project was set up and configured with
  Webpack and Babel, facilitating efficient bundling, transpiling, and
  optimization of the codebase for production deployment.

5. **Responsive Design**: The game is designed to be responsive, ensuring an
  enjoyable and seamless gaming experience across a wide range of devices,
  from desktops to mobile phones.

6. **Netlify Deployment**: The game is deployed on Netlify, a powerful
  and user-friendly platform for hosting static websites. This ensures
  reliable and scalable hosting with continuous integration and automated
  deployment workflows.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
- **Build Tools**: Webpack, Babel
- **Deployment**: Netlify

## Objectives

- Gain proficiency in React for building dynamic and interactive user
  interfaces.
- Master Redux Toolkit for efficient state management in complex applications.
- Understand and implement Webpack and Babel for project setup, bundling, and
  transpilation.
- Learn deployment best practices using Netlify, including continuous
